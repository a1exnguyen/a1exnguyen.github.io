        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Public PolicyðŸ’Œ</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi! My name is Alexandra Nguyen and I am currently a 2nd year Public Policy student at UC Riverside. I have experience with drafting policy briefs, as well as exposure to similar fields. I am currently involved on campus in a number of organizations, such as Vietnamese Student Association, ASUCR, EcoCar, and more. I am currently on the pre-law track, and am looking for experience within the pre law industry.<br><br>

        Some of my strengths include being a team player, and adaptable. During my time in the Vietnamese Student Association, Iâ€™ve been an intern, Co-Welcoming Chair, and am currently serving as Internal Vice President. As VSA is the largest culture club on the UC Riverside campus, I have gained experience in dealing with large numbers of people. I have been tasked with creating a warm and welcoming environment for those in my community. I had the pleasure of planning our Welcome Week, which was a four day event that entailed various fundraisers and social events that were crucial to recruiting members for our club. During this event, I had to coordinate with my fellow staff members and delegate tasks in order to ensure that the event was successful. Joining the Vietnamese Student Association at UC Riverside demonstrates my commitment to upholding my culture, and gave me the opportunity to create a safe space for a marginalized group of students. I wanted to ensure that each student, Vietnamese or not, has a welcoming environment that they feel comfortable joining. I have expanded these skills during my ongoing service as Internal Vice President. I aimed to establish Vietnamese Student Associationâ€™s on campus presence during my time. In order to do so, I have collaborated with various other cultural organizations on campus, in order to display the importance of intersectionality. I have also had the opportunity to get involved with philanthropy, and was a volunteer for SAP-VN, in raising awareness and money for their Mobile Medical Care project. Together, me and my peers raised over seven-thousand dollars for this cause. I plan to continue my philanthropic work, as well as emphasizing its importance to my peers. Universal access to medical care ensures fostering equity, and overall well-being for all individuals.<br><br>

        Alongside being part of the Vietnamese Student Association, I have also worked at Pandora Jewelry. Pandoraâ€™s main values revolve around curating a personalized experience for our customers, which I aimed to do. I had firsthand experience in raising sales for our customers. Furthermore, my strong interpersonal and communication skills have enabled me to collaborate effectively with cross-functional teams and provide comprehensive training to staff, fostering a positive and motivated work environment. I have consistently exceeded sales targets and fostered long-lasting client relationships. Throughout my time at Pandora, I have honed my skills in product knowledge, staying abreast of the latest jewelry trends, and effectively communicating the unique value of each piece to a diverse pool of clients. My commitment to providing an unparalleled shopping experience has resulted in increased customer satisfaction and repeat business.
